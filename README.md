# VideoPlayer-Clone
Another useful clone of my favorite windows app! Video Player!

This specific Program have the following known bugs:
-Application is not responsive. Minimizing screen will cause slider to malfunction.
-The play and pause function is not synchronized. Currently its seperated into two buttons. One button to do both functions will need to replace the two.
